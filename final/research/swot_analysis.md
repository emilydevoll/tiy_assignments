#SWOT Analysis

##Strengths
* An interactive website that allows artists to exhibit their artwork for free without having to create their own personal website.
* Continues the idea of "Keep Austin Local" by allowing users to buy art from local artists living in Austin.
* Allows artists to see what other artists in their community are creating and gives them the means to reach out to them if they want to collaborate.
* Provides a calender to know of all upcoming art events and festivals.

##Weaknesses
* The site's success depends on the amount of artists who post their work.
* Could be difficult spreading word about the site.
* Could decrease sales turn outs from festivals.
* Difficulty monitoring the website's content (some art isn't considered "kid friendly").

##Opportunities
* Currently no other website available to offer all of the features geared towards artists.
* Potential for numerous great social networking features in the future: "like/follow" artists and receive updates on new work they've posted, notified of what artists will be showing their work at upcoming festivals or other art events.
* The possibility to buy the art through the website.
* Artists can receive notifications of upcoming festivals and deadlines and save directly to their calender.
* Art store locater feature that notifies of specific art supplies and prices.
* Allow the possibility for artists to rate and review festivals based on crowd turn out and sales turn out.
* Supply rental forum that allows artists to post items they are looking to borrow/rent: tents, tables, etc.

##Threats
* Etsy is already an extremely well known platform to buy and sell art; they have a search option to set perimeters to a specific city.
* Instagram already provides the social networking aspect of being able to like and follow an artist's artwork.
