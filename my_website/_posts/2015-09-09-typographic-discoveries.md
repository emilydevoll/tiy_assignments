#Typographic Discoveries

For our restaurant website redesign project, we were given our first assignment in choosing typefaces. Being that I
have always loved typography and how it was my first step into the art world (friends used to pay me to make signs with
names/quotes in cool fonts for them to give as gifts), I was really looking forward to the assignment and in all honesty,
I figured it was going to be a breeze... then we learned about the purpose of font choices in UI Design. **Mind. Blown.**

All this time I figured I'd be getting to choose fonts that I think look cool, when in reality font selection is based
purely on the concept/design of the website you are selecting them for. Going in to my selection process knowing that
I would have to provide reasoning behind my choices other than "because I thought the font was cool" **completely**
threw me off. Not to mention there are extremely limited choices when it comes to fonts that are web safe and can be
used in CSS/SASS, at least in comparison to the billions of fonts I used to go off of when I would make my signs.
It was like I no longer had any idea of what fonts were "attractive" and what fonts worked well together.
It didn't help any that the restaurant I'm redesigning for is Asian food. Because I was so caught up on knowing I would
have to back my selection, all the fonts I was working with seemed over the top Asian style (which don't get me wrong I
know they can work extremely well in certain situations, but for my design asthetic I generally find them completely
revolting) and in my opinion looked "cheap". A little background on my definition of the word "cheap" when it comes to
design, because I gauruntee I will use that word a lot in my blogs: amature choices, ill-fitting, not cohesive, unrefined,
and overall just plain ugly.

Anyways, so then Abby told me to think beyond the surface of the style of food, and more based on the design directions
I was thinking about going in. Granted, this opened up a whole new group of choices, but for some reason I still couldn't
get passed thinking that none of the fonts looked cohesive with the design unless they had Asian elements to them.
Ultimately, I know I'm just over thinking it all, but regardless it's still super frustrating.
I'm hoping that as time goes on and we do this a billion more times,
that I'll start trusting my creative eye to make the right choices. But as for now, I feel like I'm an elementary school
kid learning to read for the first time and none of the words/fonts I'm putting together are making any sense. 

Dear future self: get back to me on this and let me know how you're doing, k?
