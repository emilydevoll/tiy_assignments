#Profile 1 - Jessica - Foreign Exchange Student

##User Story
Jessica is a 16 year old high school student who lives with her parents and twin 4 year old brothers in a comfortable suburban home. 
Jessica's favorite past time is playing the Kim Kardashian: Hollywood game app on her phone while tweeting/posting photos
on instagram and facebook of her favorite celebrity fashion trends. She has more friends online than in real life and
considers chatting on facebook with kids she has met through Kim Kardashian fanpages as her main form of socializing.
Despite all the time she spends online, she isn't the brightest crayon in the box and wouldn't consider herself as
being "tech savvy".

##User Scenario
Jessica just found out that her family will be hosting a female foreign exchange student from France. She is excited
about getting to live with someone her own age and potentially having a new best friend. Considering she not only wants 
to impress her guest by being able to speak French, but she wants to make them feel more at home, too. She posts a status
on facebook asking her friends for suggestions on websites or apps that make learning a new language easy when one of
her friends suggested Duolingo.

#Profile 2 - Tod - Traveling Business Man

##User Story
Tod is a 38 year old CEO of a global conglomerate with branches on every continent except Antarctica. He is always on
the move, be it flying in his private jet, going from one meeting to the next, or working out at the gym. He hardly
has time to sit down at a computer so he handles all his work and personal interactions on his phone. He lives alone
with no children or pets. He is all work and no play, except for his one hobby: crossfit.

##User Scenario
Although Tod can speak and understand almost all languages to an extent, he can not speak any of them fluently or 
write in a different language to save his life. This is extremely embarassing during business transactions and he has
finally had enough. Because of his hectic schedule, Tod doesn't have time to get a private instructor. While on a flight
to whatever country they speak Esperanto in, he decided to google a website he can use to touch up on all his foreign language skills
while on flights, running at the gym, and between business meetings.

#Profile 3 - Gertrude - Bored Grandmother
 
##User Story
Gertrude is an 81 year old mother to 3 kids, grandmother to 7 grandkids , and soon to be great-grandmother with one
great-grandchild on the way. She lives in a senior living community with her husband who she's been married to for 
63 years. The most activity she has had on a computer is watching the grandkids play on their iphones and the little bit
they have shown her on using Google. She is extremely hard of hearing and also has poor vision.

##User Scenario
Gertrude's senior living community just got new computers. Since she has knitted enough sweaters for every kid in America
and her UNO stats are untouchable, she figured why not use the new fancy machines to start a new hobby. Considering she
has never traveled outside the U.S., she thought learning a new language would be exotic so she googled "learn a new
language" and found Duolingo.

##Use Cases
* User clicks on website from Google.
* User arrives on homepage.
* User selects Spanish because it is the first language and she doesn't know what a lot of the other languages are.
* User watches tutorial, but gets confused on what exactly it's telling her to do.
* User selects Basics.

* User can't find diacritics buttons to get answers right.
* User gives up and turns off computer.

##Possible Items to Test/Optimize
1. Accessibility: audio volume and extra slow options.
2. Colors and size of fonts and images: ability to see.
3. Functionality of tutorial - easy to read, understand, use, fully explains website's functions.
