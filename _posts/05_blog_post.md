#Prototypes

In class today we had our first experience dealing with paper prototypes. What are prototypes you ask? Well according to _Prototypes - The Beginners Guide_ from [theuxreview.co.uk](http://theuxreview.co.uk/prototypes-the-beginners-guide/) a prototype is:

>"...a quasi-realistic representation of what you are building that can be interacted with and tested on users in order to help validate your design."

Or to put it in a way normal people would understand: it's using paper, household items, etc. to create a makeshift model that resembles what the real version would look like, only simplified, and can physically be messed with by someone in order to see whether or not the real version will actually work before you go wasting a bunch of time creating something that's completely useless. Obviously this is super handy when it comes to web design, considering it takes **SO MUCH TIME** to do all the coding for websites and the whole purpose in having functions and features is for them to work properly and effectively.

We got the opportunity in class to work hands on with prototypes by creating and testing our own. We were split into teams of two and each team was assigned a different airline's website. The reasoning behind using an airline's site as our example was because apparently they're known to be full of bugs and poorly executed features. Considering I try to avoid flying as much as possible, I'm never on airline sites and had no idea of this tendancy, but literally within 
seconds of visiting [Delta Airlines](http://www.delta.com/) it became apparent to me what our instructor was talking about. 

##Our Instructions
1. Explore the site.
2. Focus on one of the flawed features.
3. Brainstorm different approaches/designs that could be implemented to make the feature more functional.
4. Select the best design.
5. Draw up a prototype of the design, using post-it notes to signify the commands performed by the user.
6. Test the prototype on two of our classmates.

##Our Prototype
The feature my partner and I chose was the navigation bar that's in place when selecting outbound and returning flights. Currently the site has it set up where it's really hard to tell where you are in the process/what exactly you're doing. Everything is really busy and you can't easily tell that the first thing you're doing is booking the outbound flight because the title bar for it gets lost in all the excessive text they have. Ultimately it's due to poor hierarchy with the font selection. But wait, there's more! If you want to go back and change the selection you made for your outbound flight once you've selected it, the only option you're given in the navigation bar is to completely start over by resubmitting the form you filled out at the very beginning where you indicated your flight information (destinations, schedule, etc). As we saw it, the main problem was they were combining too many steps into one by lumping the outbound and return flights into a general "flights" step in the navigation bar. 

Our solution (and design we selected from our brainstorming) was to extend the navigation bar options so that the outbound and return flights would be separate steps with their own individual navigation icons, therefore allowing the user to go back at any given time and edit their selection for either of the flights without having to start all over from the beginning. We also decided to simplify the title bar and "change it's color" (designated on our prototype by drawing lines behind the text) to make it easier for the user to know what page they are on/what task they are performing. We used the post-it notes to signify the change made in the navigation bar after the user performed their command. The post-it note started on top of the "outbound flight" icon and then moved to on top of the "return flight" icon after the user selected which outbound flight they wanted and were taken to the return flight options page.

##The Test
First of all, due to time restraints we didn't get to do a prototype test example as a class, so neither of none of us (both the tester and the user) knew what exactly we were supposed to do or say while testing the prototype. Ultimately the tester told the user exactly what to do for each step, which we later learned is exactly what you're **not** supposed to do. When doing a prototype test, the user is supposed to go about using the prototype as if they were actually performing the tasks on the website, while verbally describing each action they are making. 

I realized during our second test that even though the prototype should be a simplified version of the real thing, it should still include everything that will actually be on the site, not just the specific feature we were testing. After the user selected their outbound flight and had moved on to the next page/step of selecting the return flight, they mentioned how they wanted to see the flight information of the outbound flight they had just selected and wanted to know where they would go to see that. We had the box drawn for where that information would be, but we didn't put enough information in it for them to know that that is what the box was for. 

Ultimately the test went well? Being that the user was able to perform the task without any confusion (at least pertaining to the design, we were all confused on what exactly we were supposed to be doing). They didn't know what about the site they were testing until we showed them the original site and they got to experience the horrible functionality of the navigation bar. Which I guess is a good thing and means that our design was a success?
