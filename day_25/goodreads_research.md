#Goodreads Research
Goodreads is an interactive website that provides the ability to: keep track of books read, progress on books currently reading, store books to read in the future, rate and review books, receive book recommendations, and share/interact with other users. The following research studies were conducted in order to define specific areas of the website that need improvement in order to better serve its users.

##User Interviews
I conducted numerous interviews with current and new users to investigate what the positive and negative aspects are of the site from the user's point of view. During the interview they were asked to join the site (if they hadn't already) and then explore/perform functions on the site as they normally would. While exploring, they were asked to comment on their experience and overall opinion (what they liked and didn't like) about the site and I documented their reactions. I was then able to narrow down my findings into what features/issues I needed to focus on based on frequently occuring comments from the interviewees. 

####Findings:
* Initial web design is too cluttered/busy.
* New users were unsure/confused about how to use any of the special features.
* The overall color scheme is boring (monotone).
* Menu icons are hard to see/use.
* Overall site is hard to navigate due to poor hierarchy.

##SWOT Analysis  
####Strengths:
* ***Alot of great interactive features.***   
   Keeping track of reading progress on books (what page they're on/percentage read), create book discussions, ask other members questions about the books, take polls/quizes, enter giveaways, be informed of upcoming book releases, etc.
* ***Great social networking tool.***  
   Can connect with friends on Facebook and Twitter by posting status updates, book recommendations, favorite quotes, and can keep track of what others are reading, have read, want to read, and their reviews all on the user's profilepage.
* ***Great purchasing ability.***  
   Provides access to buy books online through Amazon and Kindle eBook, or locate in a nearby library or store. Also gives preview of the book so users can read some before they buy it.
* ***Widely known with loyal fan base.***  
   Multiple positive reviews from users online. Through Facebook/Twitter connection users share their experience with others and in turn advertise the website which results in more members joining.

####Weaknesses:
* ***Too busy/cluttered.***  
   There is too much unnecessary content cluttering up the pages, making it difficult to maneuver through everything.
* ***Not enough explanation on how to use features.***  
   The user only knows what all the site offers/how to use all the features by messing around and exploring every aspect of the site. They don't have an "about" section informing users of all of the site's functions. Without it, the site looks like just another book review website at first glance.
* ***Poor hierarchy.***  
   Not a well defined variation of content positioning/sizing to indicate importance and direct the viewer's attention to necessary functions.
* ***Visually boring/displeasing.***  
   Color choices are bland and monotone, not much variation, goes back to problems with hierarchy.
* ***Hard to navigate.***  
   Navigation icons are hard to see/use. Overall site is hard to navigate through due to poor hierarchy and content overload.

####Opportunities:
* ***Utilizing all the features.***  
   The site already offers so many great features that other competitor sites don't offer. If utilized better, the site is capable of standing apart from the rest and ultimately increase the turn around for potential members over its competitors.
* ***Selling books through the actual site.***  
   If the site started selling the books themselves and cut out the third party vendors it would not only make the site more inclusive as well as profitable, but it would also make the experience easier for the user.
* ***View and store electronic copies of books on the site.***  
   Following the addition of being able to buy books through the actual site, giving the option to save and view the entire book through the site would further enhance the user's experience by discarding their need for additonal apps they'd normally need to view an electronic copy of a book.
* ***Upload previous purchased/downloaded electronic copies of books.***  
   Following being able to view ebooks on the site, adding the ability to upload ebooks the user already has stored on their computers/phones would enhance the user's experience even more by making the website 100% all inclusive.

####Threats:
* ***Poor design/difficult to navigate.***  
   Although competitor sites may not have as many features, users may be drawn more to other sites that are easier to use and navigate through.
* ***Negative effects of social networking tool.***  
   Although the social networking tool provides numerous positive attributes to the site, there is potential for it to possibly cause damage. If one of the users discovered a better site with just as many features that is easier to maneuver, they could easily share it with all of their friends and result in the loss of more members than they would if they didn't have the social networking tool.
