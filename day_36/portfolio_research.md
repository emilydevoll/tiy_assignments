#Portfolio Research
The following survey was conducted in order to aid towards the creation of a design for my personal website and portfolio.
The questions were aimed in a way to help me think outside the box and create a design that embodies me as a whole, not
just what I think of myself.

##Questions
1. What color(s) do you think best describes me?
2. Which element (earth, fire, wind, water) best describes my personality?
3. Based on an animal's personality characteristics, which one do you think best relates to me?
4. If I could live anywhere in the world, where would I live?
5. What movie do you think I best relate to?
6. What artist/art movement best signifies my personality?
7. What 3 (or more) words do you think best describes me?
