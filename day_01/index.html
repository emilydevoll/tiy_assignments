				<p>My parents, Bob and Pam, have been married for almost 36 years. They recently retired from working in the Richardson Independent School District where my father was the Superintendent of all secondary schools and my mother was a high school teacher. They now live next door to my grandmother at our lake house on Lake Texoma in Denison, Tx.</p>

				<p>I have one brother, Chad. He lives with his wife, Valerie, and three daughters in Richardson, Tx. The older two, Aubreigh and Kayla, are his step-daughters with the youngest being BrynLee. I absolutely adore my nieces, being an aunt is the greatest thing in the world. Not getting to see them everyday is the hardest part about living in Austin, but I visit them as much as I can.</p>

				<p class="osu">I attended Oklahoma State University where I majored in Human Development Family Science; Child and Family Services. While there I joined the Pi Beta Phi sorority. All I enjoyed about being in a sorority was all of the t-shirts they give you. 80% of the time you will see me wearing a Pi Phi shirt because I have so many.</p>

					<p>I have a 4 year old Mini Austrailian Shepherd named Atticus, or "Atti" for short. He has two different colored eyes: one's half blue and half brown and the other is a swirl of blue and brown. When he gets super excited he literally smiles, but since it looks like he's growling without making any noise he gets self-conscience and tries covering it up. He is the best dog in the world, it's a proven fact.</p>

					<p>I started drawing in March 2013 as a distraction from my mom's fight with breast cancer. A year later I started receiving a lot of requests for paid portraits, so many that I ended up quitting my job as a Child Care Director in Dallas and moving to Austin for better artistic opportunities. I primarily do photorealism in graphite, but have started trying out watercolors and colored pencils and plan to try painting next.</p>
